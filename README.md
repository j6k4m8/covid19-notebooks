> Each notebook in this repository is meant to be (more-or-less*) entirely standalone, meaning you can download that notebook and run it without cloning the repository or having special filesystem paths hardcoded anywhere.

> This also means that the code isn't the most elegant because every notebook needs to have all of the same utility functions. If you can think of a better way to manage this, please let me know!
